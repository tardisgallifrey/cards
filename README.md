# A Java console playing cards app

This is the beginnings of a console app to play regular cards, as in a 52 card deck.

`createDeck()` will generate an `ArrayList<Card>` with all 52 cards in order, just like it comes out of the box.

`shuffleDeck(ArrayList<Card> deck)` will return a shuffled deck of cards.  An improved shuffle might use an integer parameter for the number of times to shuffle the deck.

There is a test that can be run on `shuffleDeck()` to ensure it is return a 52 card deck with all unique values.

As always, use at your own risk.
